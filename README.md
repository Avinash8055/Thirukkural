Thirukkural Project 
Developed a python-based GUI application utilizing Natural Language Processing(NLP) to process speech input and retrieve relevant Thirukkural verses.
Engineered the application to recognize specific words from user input, accurately identify the corresponding Thirukkural verse and provide audio playback of the verse in Tamil.
Implemented a feature to display the translated meaning of the Thirukkural verse in English, enhancing access accessibility for non-Tamil speakers.
